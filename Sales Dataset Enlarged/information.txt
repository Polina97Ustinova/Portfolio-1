About Dataset:
Looking painstakingly at the dataset, it's noticeable that some inconsistencies are messing up our data.
In fact, the columns Product and line should count for a sigle attribut. 
Then, the actual observation should be Camping Equipment. 
Similarily, columns such as Retailer and country, are undergoing the same issue. 
In addition, the values of the rows regarding the attributs order and method do not convey any relevant information.
Consequently, some supplemental work need to be done in the analysis.


#### What to do:
¤ Clean data by putting it in correct columms (Python)
  ¤ change product line to Camping Equipment
  ¤  change country and retailer
  ¤ rearenge them (columns)
¤ Visualize it (Tableu)
