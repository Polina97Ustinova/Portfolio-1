######About Dataset:
The concern with this Dataset is that views and likes are our attributs of interest so they shouldn't be loaded as row values. 
Instead, they must be displayed as column names. 
As a result, we addressed this in the related notebook.

######What to do?
¤ Clean it (by putting everything in correct columms) (Python)

¤ Sort by what bigger and what smaller (python)

¤ Visualize it (Tableu)
